                Geothermal heat pumps transport heat with 2-3 times more efficiency than air source heat pumps.
                They use ground temperature, which is more reliable than air temperature in terms of its fluctuations.
                The temperature of the first 10 ft of ground is between about 45° to 75°F. Overall, however, the
                temperature is between 50° to 60°F. Air temperatures range from under 0° to over 100°F. Geothermal
                heat pumps are generally more expensive, but these costs can be regained with energy saving over a span
                of 10 to 15 years.

                As the name suggests, solar water heating systems derive their energy from the sun. These systems heat
                water using insulated storage tanks and solar collectors (harvests heat from the sun). On the downside,
                these mechanisms require an additional supplementary system when there is not enough natural sunlight.

                Solar energy systems, also known as solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, harvest energy from the sun. This
                energy, however, is converted into electricity. These systems can provide energy for all the electrical
                needs of a house, given there is enough sunlight. Solar cells are the fundamental particles that make up
                PV systems.
                Solar panels can withstand bad weather and the effects of harmful ultraviolet rays. They can also be
                aligned to form array patterns, and can be mounted on both stationary and moving surfaces. Solar energy
                systems are low maintenance.

              <p>
                Wind energy systems harvest wind and convert it into electrical energy. This energy is abundant enough
                to power all of the electrical needs of one home. They can often be combined with solar energy systems
                and a battery storage/external power source to create a backup energy option. Mechanically, turning on
                the rod of a wind mill generates the energy (size of wind mill and speed of turning shafts is directly
                proportional to the amount of energy generated). Homeowners should have at least one acre of land and
                average yearly wind speeds of at least 10 mph. Wind energy systems are typically 40 to 160 ft.
