          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Geothermal heat pumps transport heat with 2-3 times more efficiency than air source heat pumps.
              They use ground temperature, which is more reliable than air temperature in terms of its fluctuations.
              The temperature of the first 10 ft of ground is between about 45° to 75°F. Overall, however, the
              temperature is between 50° to 60°F. Air temperatures range from under 0° to over 100°F. Geothermal
              heat pumps are generally more expensive, but these costs can be regained with energy saving over a span
              of 10 to 15 years.

          <button class="accordion">Solar water heating</button>

            <p>
              As the name suggests, solar water heating systems derive their energy from the sun. These systems heat
              water using insulated storage tanks and solar collectors (harvests heat from the sun). On the downside,
              these mechanisms require an additional supplementary system when there is not enough natural sunlight.

          <button class="accordion">Solar energy systems</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Also known as solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, these systems similarly harvest energy from the sun. This
              energy, however, is converted into electricity. These systems can provide energy for all the electrical
              needs of a house, given there is enough sunlight. Solar cells are the "building blocks" of PV systems.
              Solar panels can withstand bad weather and the effects of harmful ultraviolet rays. They can also be
              aligned to form array patterns, and can be mounted on both stationary and moving surfaces. Solar energy
              systems are low maintenance.

          <button class="accordion">Wind energy systems</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Wind energy systems harvest wind and convert it into electrical energy. This energy is abundant enough
              to power all of the electrical needs of one home. They can often be combined with solar energy systems
              and a battery storage/external power source to create a backup energy option. Mechanically, turning on
              the rod of a wind mill generates the energy (size of wind mill and speed of turning shafts is directly
              proportional to the amount of energy generated). Homeowners should have at least one acre of land and
              average yearly wind speeds of at least 10 mph. Wind energy systems are typically 40 to 160 ft.
